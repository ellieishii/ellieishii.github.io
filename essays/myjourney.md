## Discovering My Interest
Software engineering and web development have always captivated my interest due their combination of creativity with analytical problem-solving. Growing up, I spent a lot of time with my grandparents who owned their own small businesses. Whenever I visited them, I would always stop by their stores before going to their home, as they were my favorite places. They played a significant role in sparking my interest in these fields, and encouraging my creativity. 

## Early Design Experience
As I grew older, I began assisting them with creating and designing menus and posters for their business. They often hosted events with famous guests, so I designed simple yet eye-catching posters to attract attention. This early experience in design taught me how to convey messages visually and engage an audience effectively. Additionally, I created a website for them using a template. My grandmother provided a list of contents and specific design requests, and I enjoyed working with her to bring her vision to life. I still remember the smile she had on her face whenever I presented my work. 

## Passion for Web Development 
This experience led to my passion for web development and my interest in pursuing a career in this field. Web development is a subset of software engineering that focuses on building web-based applications and services that run on web browsers or web servers. It emphasizes creating user-friendly interfaces, user experiences, and ensuring that web applications are accessible and responsive. The ability to work on projects that directly impact users and address real-world problems aligns with my desire to combine creativity with technical skills. 

## Embracing Growth in an Ever-Evolving Field
Furthermore, software engineering is an ever-evolving field that presents continuous learning opportunities and challenges. It plays a crucial role in this modern technology, given how the internet has become a foundational element of our daily lives. With new technologies and programming languages, there will always be something new to learn and explore. I am very excited to embrace these challenges and be part of the future technology in this field.
