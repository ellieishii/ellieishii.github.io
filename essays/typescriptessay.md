## Learning Programming as a New Language
Learning new programming languages is similar to learning new spoken languages, at least in my experience. It takes a lot of time and practice to become fluent, and it’s easy to lose proficiency if you don’t use it frequently enough. I often find similarities between learning a new programming language and mastering a foreign language. Both experiences require understanding new syntax, concepts, and structures. As someone with some experience in C and Java but completely new to TypeScript, I see it as an entirely new journey, though it doesn’t seem too intimidating. From a software engineering perspective, I think TypeScript can make coding easier once you become accustomed to it. 

## What Sets TypeScript Apart from Other Languages

What makes TypeScript stand out to me is its ability to specify the type of data being passed around in the code, along with a built-in type checking system that helps catch errors at compile time before the code is executed. This feature is incredibly useful; it allows me to identify issues on the spot without needing to run the code each time to check for errors. Additionally, I appreciate that I don’t have to write long lines just to print something, unlike in Java. Therefore, I think it would be very useful and exciting if I become proficient in this programming language. I am excited to see how far TypeScript will take me in my career.

## Challenges and Growth with WODs
WOD (Workout of the Day) is designed to test our problem-solving skills and efficiency by assigning time limits and a grading scale of either pass (100%) or fail (0%), with no partial credits. This style of learning effectively stimulates real-world scenarios, where I am required to code efficiently and correctly on the spot. The practice WODs are helpful because they allow me to learn the format of the test and prepare for the actual one by solving similar questions. Practicing for WODs will also help prepare me for the real-world situations.  

## Mixed Feelings About Time Pressure in WODs
When I was first introduced to this practice, it sounded extremely stressful. The short time limit is what worries me the most because I prefer having more time to think and organize my thoughts before starting to code. However, I realize that the skills we practice in WODs are essential in this field. Although I have mixed feelings about this practice, I see it as a great opportunity to gain experience and improve for the future. I believe these practices will contribute to my growth as a software engineer.
